# ComputationalThinkingProject
This is a project I completed to test my own selection of algorithims and their speeds in relation to sizes ranging between 100 and 20000.
The process of researching, implementing, and testing various algorithms gave me hands-on experience in analyzing and evaluating their performance,
strengths, and weaknesses. This helped me to understand how different algorithms can be applied to solve similar problems in different ways, 
and the trade-offs between time complexity, memory usage, and other factors. Overall, the project enhanced my ability to think logically and 
systematically when approaching computational problems, and gave me a stronger foundation in algorithms and data structures.

### Prerequisites
    â€¢ Java 8 or higher
    
### Running the Program
    1. Download and compile the repository
    2. Run the Runner.java file
    3. A table will be printed to the console showing the speeds of the sorting algorithms in miliseconds
